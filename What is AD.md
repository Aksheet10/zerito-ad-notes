# What is AD 
---

 Active Directory is a system that allows to manage a set of computers and users connected in the same network from a central server.
 
 Active Directory network is also called as a #Domain 
 A maintains a centralized database where all the information about users, computers, policies, permissions, etc, is stored.
 
 Then, when one of these interns tries to login to a computer inside the Active Directory network, the computer consults the central database in order to check that the intern user exists (and that the password is correct). This way, users can log on to any of the company computers (if they have permissions), by allowing employees to use only a user to do all its work in all the company computers (that can be workstations, database servers, file servers, etc).
